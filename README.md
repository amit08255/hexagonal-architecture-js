> Hexagonal Architecture defines that an application‚Äôs business logic should be isolated from the external applications.

> The main goal of this architecture is to avoid knows structural pitfalls in software design. Such as the pollution of UI code with business logic or undesired dependencies between layers. Therefore it aims at creating loosely coupled components that can be connected to their software environments using ‚Äúports‚Äù and ‚Äúadapters‚Äù.

## ‚û§ Walkthrough


### Built With

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)


### Introduction
The term ‚ÄúHexagonal Architecture‚Äù stems from Alistair Cockburn and has been around for quite some time14. It applies the same principles that Robert C. Martin later described in more general terms in his Clean Architecture.

<div align="center">
	<a href=""><img src="./.docs/diag.png" alt="Diagram" /></a>
</div>

Within the hexagon, we find our domain entities and the use cases that work with them. Note that the hexagon has no outgoing dependencies, so that the Dependency Rule from Martin‚Äôs Clean Architecture holds true. Instead, all dependencies point towards the center.

Outside of the hexagon, we find various adapters that interact with the application. There might be a web adapter that interacts with a web browser, some adapters interacting with external systems and an adapter that interacts with a database.

**The adapters on the left side are adapters that drive our application (because they call our application core) while the adapters on the right side are driven by our application (because they are called by our application core).**

**To allow communication between the application core and the adapters, the application core provides specific ports.** For driving adapters, such a port might be an interface that is implemented by one of the use case classes in the core and called by the adapter. For a driven adapter, it might be an interface that is implemented by the adapter and called by the core.

The domain code has no dependencies to the outside so we can decouple our domain logic from all those persistence and UI specific problems and reduce the
number of reasons to change throughout the codebase. And less reasons to change means better maintainability.

The domain code is free to be modelled as best fits the business problems while the persistence and UI code are free to be modelled as best fits the persistence and UI problems.

### File Structure

```
src/
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄapp/                   * WebApp: folder, our source files that will be compiled to javascript
 ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ--shared/            * Do put all shared files within a component feature in a shared folder.
 |   |   |-- exception.service.ts
 |   |   |-- exception.service.spec.ts
 |   |   |-- shared.module.ts * shared module with all shared declarations and providers
 |   |   |-- index.ts             * barrel file
 ‚îÇ   |--app.module.ts      * angular module
 ‚îÇ   |--app.component.ts   * root component
 ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄapp.spec.ts        * a simple test of components in app.ts

 ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄservice-worker.js  * ignore this. Web App service worker that's not complete yet
 ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄrobots.txt         * for search engines to crawl your website
 ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄhuman.txt          * for humans to know who the developers are
 |‚îÄ‚îÄmain.ts        * our entry file for our browser environment
 ‚îÇ
 |‚îÄ‚îÄindex.html     * Index.html: where we generate our index page
 ‚îÇ
 |‚îÄ‚îÄpolyfills.ts   * our polyfills file
 ‚îÇ
 |‚îÄ‚îÄvendor.ts      * our vendor file
 |
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄglobals.d.ts   * our custom global type definitions
```

### Testing Setup
All tests are also written in ES6. We use Webpack to take care of the logistics of getting those files to run in the various browsers, just like with our client files. This is our testing stack:
* Karma
* Webpack + Babel
* Mocha
* Chai

To run tests, type `npm test` in the terminal. Read more about testing [below](#testing).

## ‚û§ Getting Started

### Dependencies
Tools needed to run this app:
* `node` and `npm`

#### Install Node.js

Node.js is an environment that can run JavaScript code outside of a web browser and is used to write and run server-side JavaScript apps. Node.js installation includes `npm`, the package manager that allows you to install NPM modules from your terminal. 
You can download an installer from the [Node.js homepage](https://nodejs.org/en/).

##### Check your Node.js installation

Check that you have the minimum required version installed by running the following command:

```sh
node -v
```

You should see a version larger than Node 10.

```sh
node -v
v12.14.0
```

> Project name' minimum supported Node.js version is Node 10, but more recent versions will work as well.


### Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install dependencies

### Running the App
NG6 uses Gulp to build and launch the development environment. After you have installed all dependencies, you may run the app. Running `npm start` will bundle the app with `webpack`, launch a development server, and watch all files. The port will be displayed in the terminal.
 
#### Tasks
Here's a list of available tasks:
* `npm run build`
  * runs Webpack, which will transpile, concatenate, and compress (collectively, "bundle") all assets and modules into `dist/bundle.js`. It also prepares `index.html` to be used as application entry point, links assets and created dist version of our application.
* `npm run serve`
  * starts a dev server via `webpack-dev-server`, serving the client folder.
* `npm run watch`
  * alias of `serve`
* `npm start` (which is the default task that runs when typing `gulp` without providing an argument)
  * runs `serve`.
* `npm run component`
  * scaffolds a new Angular component. [Read below](#generating-components) for usage details.
  
### Testing
To run the tests, run `npm test`.

`Karma` combined with Webpack runs all files matching `*.spec.js` inside the `app` folder. This allows us to keep test files local to the component--which keeps us in good faith with continuing to build our app modularly. The file `spec.bundle.js` is the bundle file for **all** our spec files that Karma will run.

Be sure to define your `*.spec.js` files within their corresponding component directory. You must name the spec file like so, `[name].spec.js`. If you don't want to use the `.spec.js` suffix, you must change the `regex` in `spec.bundle.js` to look for whatever file(s) you want.
`Mocha` is the testing suite and `Chai` is the assertion library. If you would like to change this, see `karma.conf.js`.

#### Examples

It's always easier to learn something if you have an examples. Here is a list of repos which based on this starter:

 - [TodoMVC Example App](https://github.com/AngularClass/NG6-todomvc-starter)

### Usage

Run the `node_modules/.bin/readme generate` command and a README file will be generated for you. If you want to go into depth with the readme command, check out the following options or write `node_modules/.bin/readme generate -h` in your terminal if that's your cup of tea.
